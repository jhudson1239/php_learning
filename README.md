# php_learning
The point of this is to learn php from the ground up. 

Whilst in University I did learn PHP through a module called Server Side Scripting, this was in my Third year of study. I learned PHP while also using the Laravel Framework at the same time, this lead to me no really learning PHP independently. So the aim is to run through tutorials from credible online sources in PHP and create files and folders along the way to develop my PHP knowledge.
